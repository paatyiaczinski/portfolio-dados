## 🔹 Annual Overview

The company's store expansion strategy between 2022 and 2023 was successful, increasing the number of stores from 42 to 85 (+102%). As a result, revenue grew by **~14%**, and profit also rose significantly. 

However, when analyzing only the stores that operated in both years, **most of them recorded a revenue drop in 2023**. The overall growth was driven primarily by the opening of new locations. Without the expansion, the company would have faced a decline in revenue and profitability.

Cities such as Canoas, Capão da Canoa, and Porto Alegre stood out positively, while Torres and Umuarama had a sharp drop in 2023 and should be reviewed.

The top 10 best-selling products are traditional items such as **Espresso com Leite**, **Água sem Gás**, and **Pão na Chapa**. On the other hand, **Suco de Acerola**, **Café Inglês**, and **Omelete Vegana** performed poorly and could be discontinued or repositioned. The data suggests opportunities to optimize the menu and align offerings with customer preferences.
