The dataset simulates real sales data provided by the business team. It includes store-level metrics such as total revenue, number of customers, and most-sold products, as well as customer segmentations and product category performance.

The case required the development of a Power BI dashboard with relevant KPIs and actionable visualizations. The final product was presented with a written report and a live demo.
