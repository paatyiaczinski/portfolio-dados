# 📊 Data Analysis Project Portfolio

Welcome to my data analysis project portfolio!  
This repository brings together practical projects focused on solving **real-world business problems**, using tools like **Power BI**, **Python**, and **SQL**.

Each project is organized in a separate folder, with documentation, dashboards, and insights.  
I’m also building an internal **technical blog** in the `/posts` folder, offering a narrative approach for each project.
