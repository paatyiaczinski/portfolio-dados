## 3. üßπ Data Cleaning and Preparation

The following transformations were applied during the ETL process:

- Null values in **Annual Salary** were replaced by the average.
- **Age** column created based on current year ‚Äì year of birth.
- **Age Range** column created using age categories.
- **RFM_Score** column calculated to segment customers based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary.
- **CustosCampanhas** table created to simulate campaign costs and enable ROI/CAC metrics.
- **RFM_Segmentos** table created for easier segmentation and insights.
- Outliers were identified using scatter plots. These values were kept, assuming they may represent relevant extreme profiles.

## 4. üß† Key DAX Formulas

### üìê Metric: ROI (Return on Investment)

**Business Concept**  
ROI measures how much return was generated for each unit of value invested in a marketing campaign.

**Standard Formula**  
ROI = (Revenue ‚Äì Cost) / Cost

**DAX Example**
```DAX
.ROICampanha1 = 
VAR ClientesCampanha = 
    FILTER(DadosMarketing, DadosMarketing[Compra na Campanha 1] = "Sim")
VAR ReceitaCampanha = 
    CALCULATE([.TotalGasto], ClientesCampanha)
VAR CustoCampanha = 
    LOOKUPVALUE('CustosCampanhas'[Custo], 'CustosCampanhas'[Campanha], "Campanha 1")
RETURN
DIVIDE(ReceitaCampanha - CustoCampanha, CustoCampanha)
```

**Justification**  
This formula helps evaluate the profitability of each campaign. The `CustosCampanhas` table allows this comparison through fictitious values.

---

### üìê Metric: RFM Segmentation

**Business Concept**  
The RFM strategy classifies customers based on Recency (last purchase), Frequency (how often they buy), and Monetary (how much they spend).

**DAX**
```DAX
RFM_Score = 
VAR RecenciaScore = 
    SWITCH(
        TRUE(),
        DadosMarketing[Dias Desde Ultima Compra] <= 30, 3,
        DadosMarketing[Dias Desde Ultima Compra] <= 90, 2,
        1
    )
VAR FreqTotal = 
    DadosMarketing[Numero de Compras na Loja] +
    DadosMarketing[Numero de Compras via Catalogo] +
    DadosMarketing[Numero de Compras na Web] +
    DadosMarketing[Numero de Compras com Desconto]
VAR FrequenciaScore = 
    SWITCH(
        TRUE(),
        FreqTotal >= 15, 3,
        FreqTotal >= 8, 2,
        1
    )
VAR ValorTotal = 
    DadosMarketing[Gasto com Eletronicos] +
    DadosMarketing[Gasto com Brinquedos] +
    DadosMarketing[Gasto com Moveis] +
    DadosMarketing[Gasto com Utilidades] +
    DadosMarketing[Gasto com Alimentos] +
    DadosMarketing[Gasto com Vestuario]
VAR MonetarioScore = 
    SWITCH(
        TRUE(),
        ValorTotal >= 2000, 3,
        ValorTotal >= 1000, 2,
        1
    )
RETURN
FORMAT(RecenciaScore, "0") & FORMAT(FrequenciaScore, "0") & FORMAT(MonetarioScore, "0")
```

**Justification**  
The formula returns a string (e.g. "321") that allows mapping to the auxiliary table `RFM_Segmentos`, simplifying insights into customer types and behavior.

---

### üìê Metric: Percentage with Children

**Business Concept**  
Analyzing family profile may reveal different consumption patterns and help personalize campaigns.

**DAX**
```DAX
.PercentualComFilhos = 
DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(FILTER(DadosMarketing, DadosMarketing[Filhos em Casa] = 1)),
    COUNTROWS(DadosMarketing)
)
```

**Justification**  
This measure supports other analyses, such as comparing average spending between customers with and without children.

## üî≠ Future Improvements

- Add Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) calculation.
- Apply clustering based on RFM score.
- Deepen analysis by channel (e.g., online vs. physical).
- Evaluate seasonality in campaign effectiveness.
- Add visual tooltips or formula breakdowns in the dashboard.
