- **CustosCampanhas**: Auxiliary table created to simulate the cost of each marketing campaign.

<details>
  <summary>üóÉÔ∏è Previous Version: <s>CustosCampanhas</s> (Deprecated)</summary>

| Campaign    | <s>Cost (BRL)</s> |
|-------------|------------------|
| Campaign 1  | <s>10,000</s>    |
| Campaign 2  | <s>8,000</s>     |
| Campaign 3  | <s>5,000</s>     |
| Campaign 4  | <s>3,000</s>     |

| 333       | VIP                 | 3       | 3          | 3         |

*(Other score combinations were also mapped.)*

-**CampanhasDesempenho** An auxiliary table created to consolidate performance indicators for each campaign:

| Campaign    | ROI    | CAC      | ConversionRate | Clients |
|-------------|--------|----------|----------------|---------|
| Campaign 1  | 376%   | R$ 145   | 7.40%          | 148     |
| Campaign 2  | 300%   | R$ 289   | 7.30%          | 146     |
| Campaign 3  | 150%   | R$ 650   | 7.15%          | 143     |
| Campaign 4  | 100%   | R$ 741   | 6.65%          | 133     |
| Campaign 5  | 12%    | R$ 1,154 | 1.30%          | 26      |

This table enabled more intuitive dashboards, side-by-side comparisons, and clearer DAX aggregations.

## 3. üßπ Data Treatment and Preparation

During the data cleaning and transformation process in Power Query, the following actions were applied:

- Filling null values in the **Annual Income** column with the column's average, aiming to retain the maximum number of records for analysis without significantly distorting the overall income distribution.
- Creation of the calculated **Age** column (`DAX: Age = YEAR(NOW()) - MarketingData[Birth Year]`).
- Creation of the calculated **Age Group** column based on age to facilitate segmentation.
- Creation of the calculated **RFM_Score** column for customer segmentation based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value (details in the DAX section).
- Creation of the auxiliary table **CampaignCosts** to enable realistic ROI and CAC calculations (details in section 2).
- Creation of the auxiliary table **RFM_Segments** to map scores to qualitative profiles (details in section 2).
- **Outlier** check (e.g., very high incomes, high spending): The decision was made to keep this data as it represents extreme but valid customer profiles relevant for analyzing segments like 'VIP'.
- Creation of the auxiliary table **CampaignPerformance**, centralizing calculated KPIs per campaign to facilitate comparative visualizations.
- **Update of campaign cost values** (`CampaignCosts`): Initial costs were revised to reflect more realistic investment figures, directly impacting the accuracy of ROI and CAC calculations. *This change was crucial for a more reliable performance evaluation.*
- **Expansion of the `RFM_Segments` table**: Added individual `Recency`, `Frequency`, and `Monetary` columns to allow for more granular analyses and filtering by each RFM component. *This enabled a better understanding of each segment's characteristics.*
- üöÄ *Future Improvement Point*: Enable campaign breakdown **by RFM segment** using the segment filter on the dashboard. Currently, this results in many blank values, indicating a need for future adjustments in modeling or data handling to ensure the integrity of cross-analyses.

## 4. üß† Main DAX Formulas Created

Below are details of some of the key metrics and calculated columns in DAX that were fundamental to the analysis. All measures used in the project can be found in the `formulas.dax` file within the repository. ([[Link to formulas.dax, if available online](https://github.com/paatyiaczinski/portifolio-dados/blob/main/marketing/formulas.dax)])


--- // (Rest of the metrics continue below)

### üìê Metric: ROI (Return on Investment)

**Business Concept**  
ROI measures how much return was generated for each unit of value invested in a marketing campaign.

**Standard Formula**  
ROI = (Revenue ‚Äì Cost) / Cost

**DAX Example**
```DAX
.ROICampanha1 = 
VAR ClientesCampanha = 
    FILTER(DadosMarketing, DadosMarketing[Compra na Campanha 1] = "Sim")
VAR ReceitaCampanha = 
    CALCULATE([.TotalGasto], ClientesCampanha)
VAR CustoCampanha = 
    LOOKUPVALUE('CustosCampanhas'[Custo], 'CustosCampanhas'[Campanha], "Campanha 1")
RETURN
DIVIDE(ReceitaCampanha - CustoCampanha, CustoCampanha)
```

**Justification**  
This formula helps evaluate the profitability of each campaign. The `CustosCampanhas` table allows this comparison through fictitious values.

---

### üìê Metric: RFM Segmentation

**Business Concept**  
The RFM strategy classifies customers based on Recency (last purchase), Frequency (how often they buy), and Monetary (how much they spend).

**DAX**
```DAX
RFM_Score = 
VAR RecenciaScore = 
    SWITCH(
        TRUE(),
        DadosMarketing[Dias Desde Ultima Compra] <= 30, 3,
        DadosMarketing[Dias Desde Ultima Compra] <= 90, 2,
        1
    )
VAR FreqTotal = 
    DadosMarketing[Numero de Compras na Loja] +
    DadosMarketing[Numero de Compras via Catalogo] +
    DadosMarketing[Numero de Compras na Web] +
    DadosMarketing[Numero de Compras com Desconto]
VAR FrequenciaScore = 
    SWITCH(
        TRUE(),
        FreqTotal >= 15, 3,
        FreqTotal >= 8, 2,
        1
    )
VAR ValorTotal = 
    DadosMarketing[Gasto com Eletronicos] +
    DadosMarketing[Gasto com Brinquedos] +
    DadosMarketing[Gasto com Moveis] +
    DadosMarketing[Gasto com Utilidades] +
    DadosMarketing[Gasto com Alimentos] +
    DadosMarketing[Gasto com Vestuario]
VAR MonetarioScore = 
    SWITCH(
        TRUE(),
        ValorTotal >= 2000, 3,
        ValorTotal >= 1000, 2,
        1
    )
RETURN
FORMAT(RecenciaScore, "0") & FORMAT(FrequenciaScore, "0") & FORMAT(MonetarioScore, "0")
```

**Justification**  
The formula returns a string (e.g. "321") that allows mapping to the auxiliary table `RFM_Segmentos`, simplifying insights into customer types and behavior.

---

### üìê Metric: Percentage with Children

**Business Concept**  
Analyzing family profile may reveal different consumption patterns and help personalize campaigns.

**DAX**
```DAX
.PercentualComFilhos = 
DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(FILTER(DadosMarketing, DadosMarketing[Filhos em Casa] = 1)),
    COUNTROWS(DadosMarketing)
)
```

**Justification**  
This measure supports other analyses, such as comparing average spending between customers with and without children.

## üî≠ Future Improvements

- Add Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) calculation.
- Apply clustering based on RFM score.
- Deepen analysis by channel (e.g., online vs. physical).
- Evaluate seasonality in campaign effectiveness.
- Add visual tooltips or formula breakdowns in the dashboard.
