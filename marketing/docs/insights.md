# 🧠 Insights – Marketing Campaign Performance

> **Campaign 1 outperformed all others in efficiency, delivering the highest ROI (376%), highest conversion rate (7.4%), and the lowest CAC (R$ 145).**

![Dashboard – Campaign Performance](../img/performance-campanhas.png)

---

## 🎯 Overview

This section evaluates the performance of marketing campaigns based on three key metrics: **ROI (Return on Investment), CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)**, and **Conversion Rate**, allowing us to identify the most effective strategies with the highest impact.

---

## 📊 Key Indicators

| Metric                     | Value          |
|---------------------------|----------------|
| Impacted Clients          | 413            |
| Average CAC               | R$ 595.82      |
| Average ROI               | 187.63%        |
| Overall Conversion Rate   | 16%            |
| Top ROI Campaign          | Campaign 1     |
| Top Conversion Campaign   | Campaign 1     |
| Lowest CAC Campaign       | Campaign 1     |

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

- **Campaign 1** stands out in every aspect: it generated the **highest ROI**, had the **lowest CAC**, and achieved the **best conversion rate** among all campaigns.
- **Campaign 5** underperformed with a **low ROI (12%)**, **high CAC (R$ 1,154)**, and **poor conversion rate (1.3%)**.
- The **ROI vs CAC scatter plot** reveals a clear trend: **lower CAC tends to be associated with higher ROI**.
- The **column + line chart** illustrates the relationship between ROI and Conversion Rate, highlighting that **efficiency is not only about volume** but also about strategy.
- The **campaign performance matrix** provides a comprehensive side-by-side comparison of each campaign’s KPIs.

---

## 💡 Strategic Opportunities

- **Scale or replicate Campaign 1’s approach**, as it proved highly efficient and profitable.
- **Reassess Campaigns 4 and 5** to understand the low performance — improvements could include better segmentation, channel selection, or message alignment.
- **Establish clear performance targets**, such as ROI > 200% and Conversion Rate > 25%, and track progress with dashboards.
- Consider **customizing campaigns by customer segment**, leveraging the RFM segmentation for more effective targeting.
- **New improvement opportunity**: it is now possible to **filter the campaign analysis by RFM segment**, enabling deeper insights. However, this feature currently introduces visual gaps where no matching data exists. Addressing this limitation could greatly enhance the dashboard's intelligence in future versions.

# 🧠 Insights – Purchase Patterns at Point of Sale

> **The United States leads in number of customers and total spending, while Portugal has the highest average ticket per customer.**

![Dashboard – Point of Sale](../img/pontos-vendas.png)

---

## 🎯 Overview

This section explores **purchase patterns by country**, analyzing differences in total customers, average ticket size, and overall spend across geographies.

⚠️ *Note*: No time-based analysis was performed due to data limitations — the dataset only includes registration and last purchase dates, with no consistent timeline of transactions. This is a limitation to be improved in future data collections.

---

## 📊 Key Indicators

| Metric                      | Value              |
|----------------------------|--------------------|
| Country with most clients  | **United States**  |
| Country with highest ticket| **Portugal**        |
| Country with highest spend | **United States**  |

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- The **United States** holds **nearly half the customer base** and leads in total spend, surpassing R$ 590K.
- However, **Portugal stands out** with the **highest average ticket** (R$ 646.10), indicating a smaller but high-value customer base.
- **Spain and Chile** also show strong purchasing power with average tickets above R$ 600.
- Spending by category shows that **Electronics dominate** in every country, followed by Furniture and Toys.
- When filtered by age group (e.g., 20–30 years), the **customer base decreases significantly**, and spend distribution shifts — reinforcing the importance of segmentation in marketing efforts.

---

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

- **Expand campaigns in countries with higher average spend**, such as Portugal and Spain, to grow the customer base in premium markets.
- **Sustain investment in the United States**, leveraging its large customer base and overall purchasing volume.
- **Target younger age groups** (e.g., 20–30) with tailored offers, as they currently represent a lower but potentially valuable segment.
- **Explore diversification across product categories**, especially for cross-selling alongside the dominant Electronics segment.
