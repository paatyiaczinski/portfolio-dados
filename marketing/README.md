# 📊 Marketing Analysis Project: Optimizing Campaigns with Data

How can we optimize marketing investments and better target campaigns by understanding customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and responses to previous actions? This portfolio project answers these questions using a simulated marketing dataset.

The focus is on applying data analysis techniques to transform raw data into actionable insights, building essential metrics (ROI, CAC, RFM), segmenting customers, and creating interactive visualizations to assist marketing managers in making strategic decisions.
