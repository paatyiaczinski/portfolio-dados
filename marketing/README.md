# 📈 Marketing Analysis Project

This project is part of a personal data analytics portfolio.
Its objective is to analyze customer profiles and behavior, measure the performance of marketing campaigns, and understand purchasing patterns using simulated data from a fictitious company.

The project is built entirely in **Power BI**, with custom metrics developed in **DAX** and documentation that bridges technical details with business storytelling.
