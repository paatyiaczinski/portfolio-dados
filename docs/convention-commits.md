# 📝 Git Commit Message Convention

This document defines the standard for writing Git commit messages in this portfolio. Following a consistent format helps maintain clarity, makes project history easier to understand, and shows professionalism in collaborative or public projects.

## ✅ Format

Each commit message should follow this structure:

<type>: <short message in English (imperative form)>

Example:  
feat: add marketing project structure and initial README

## 🔖 Common Commit Types

feat: Adds a new feature, folder, file, or meaningful content  
docs: Documentation changes only (e.g., .md files, blog posts, README)  
fix: Fixes a bug, typo, or broken link  
refactor: Code or structure improvement with no functional change  
style: Formatting or layout changes that don’t affect logic  
chore: Maintenance tasks like updating .gitignore or renaming files  
test: Adds or modifies tests

## 🔠 Message Style Guidelines

- Always write in English  
- Use the imperative form:  
  ✅ add, create, update  
  ❌ added, created, updating  
- Keep the message short and clear (ideally ≤ 72 characters)  
- Optionally, add a second line with extra details:  

Example:  
feat: add segmentation project folder  
Includes README and placeholder for future scripts

## 📌 Examples

feat: create posts folder and add first blog post  
docs: update project structure documentation  
fix: correct typo in marketing README  
refactor: reorganize docs folder for clarity  
chore: update .gitignore to exclude backup files

## 📎 Why it matters

- Helps understand what was done at a glance  
- Makes the Git history searchable and useful  
- Shows attention to detail — especially in public portfolios
